# Valheim-Mods
 
A collection of mods that I created for Valheim. If you have any questions or comments contact me on discord: (Jbeast291 0001). I originally made these to fix some of the annoyances when I played valheim with a small group of friends. I make no promises to keep these up to date but in case you want the source code here it is. Also if you want to update my mods to a later version just make a pull request.

## [Always allow Teleport]
Very simple mod that allows you to use teleportors when you are carying ores or unteleportable items.


## [Water Remover]
Very simple mod that can have some unexpected side effects. In short when you press F9 it removes all the water arround you and you can walk freely under the sea. If you press F10 it restores the deleted water and you will go to the surface if you were underwater. There are many side effects to this like boats falling to the bottom of the ocean so use at your own risk
